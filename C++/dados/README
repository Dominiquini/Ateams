This directory contains a set of test problems.  

la01-la40 are from "Resource constrained project scheduling: an experimental
investigation of heuristic scheduling techniques" by S. Lawrence.  

mt06, mt10, and mt20 are from "Industrial Scheduling" edited by Muth and
Thompson.  

car1-car8 are from "Ordonnancements a contraintes disjonctives" by
J. Carlier. 

orb1-orb10 were generated in Bonn in 1986.

Each problem conists of a line of description, a line containing the number
of jobs and the number of machines, and then one line for each job, listing
the machine number and processing time for each step of the job.  The
machines are numbered starting with 0.

The file VALUES contains the value of the optimal solution for the problems
that we have solved, and our best lower and upper bounds for those which we
haven't solved.
